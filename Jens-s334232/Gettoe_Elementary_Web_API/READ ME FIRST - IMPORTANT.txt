HI guys,

This is the latest code for the Web API:

I have also included the database if you don't want to do any db migrations.
2 Database options: DO EITHER 1

1.)Restore the database from the .bak file (Gettoe_Elementary.bak)

2.)Create an empty database called: school_applications_db
Then run the script(elementary.sql)

NOTE: 
REMEMBER TO SET YOUR SQL CONNECTION STRING IN THE appsettings.json FILE IN THE WEB_API PROJECT... 

Finally:

I have enabled CORS for the web api. So you will need to just add the urls of the apps which will be calling the api.
I have included http://localhost:4200 for the angular app. But if you want to add more, just go to the appsettings.json
file and add more urls to the CORS:site variable. Just use commas eg:
//CORS
  "CORS": {
    "site": "http://localhost:4200,http://localhost:3214,http://localhost:5002" 
  },
